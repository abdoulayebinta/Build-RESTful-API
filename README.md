# The app: Health and fitness app
An application that integrates with the Fitbit system https://www.fitbit.com/home. With the current, mobile-first approach to deveopment, it's crucial to have a good API for mobile and web projects. 
In this project, I create a RESTful API with Node.js and Hapi. I use MongoDB as the backend database.


### Installation
```
> git clone https://github.com/abdoulayebinta/Build-RESTful-API.git
> cd Build-RESTful-API
> npm install
> run your local mongodb database 
> npm start
```
Go to your localhost:  http://localhost:8000 and play with the different endpoints (I'll add more). With the full *CRUD* operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) via *curl*, *httpie* or *postman*.
